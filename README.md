Selenium Automation Assignment – SauceDemo Website. (https://www.saucedemo.com/)

This project contains Selenium automation scripts for the SauceDemo website.
Each task is written separately for clarity and easy execution.

Flow of Execution:
1. Open the project in any Java IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ).
2. Navigate to:
   src > test > java > Syfe_Assesment > Assesment
3. Run the required task file (Task_1.java to Task_6.java) individually.
4. The browser will open and perform the automation steps for that task.

Tools Used:
- Java
- Selenium WebDriver
- Chrome Browser

Notes:
- Each task is independent and can be executed separately.
- Small waits are added where page loading is dynamic.
